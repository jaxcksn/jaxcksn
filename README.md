# Hi, My name is Jackson ðŸ¤ 

First of all, welcome to my Github. I'm a junior at Texas Tech University getting a Computer Science degree and studying to become a software engineer.

I mainly work with Javascript and React but sometimes you might see me use some C or Java.
I also do some graphic design work on the side, including UI design.

### Check Out My Latest Project:
[CS Degree Plan Tool](csplan.jaxcksn.dev) - Build a Texas Tech Computer Science degree plan from the comfort of your browser and share it or save it to work on later. (Built with ReactJS, check out the [source code here](https://github.com/jaxcksn/CompSciDegreePlan))
