# Howdy, My Name is Jackson ðŸ¤ 

First of all, welcome to my Github. I'm a junior at Texas Tech University working on a Computer Science degree and studying to become a software engineer.

My favorite language/technology to work with is Javascript, React and React Native but sometimes you might see me using some C or Java.
I also do some graphic design work on the side, including UI design.

### ðŸ”¨ Check Out My Latest Project
[CS Degree Plan Tool](https://csplan.jaxcksn.dev/) - Build a Texas Tech Computer Science degree plan from the comfort of your browser and share it or save it to work on later. (Built with ReactJS, check out the [source code here](https://github.com/jaxcksn/CompSciDegreePlan))
